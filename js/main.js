When I‚Äôm not at IYH, I love to work in the healthcare industry and in influencer marketing, as well as dance, play instruments, and travel. Additionally, I am a huge foodie so if you ever need a restaurant recommendation don‚Äôt hesitate to reach out! I love to watch anything sci-fi or marvel related, and my kryptonite is a movie soundtrack or anything by Hans Zimmer. I could watch The Princess Bride on repeat and am concerningly addicted to soul cycle. Finally and obviously, because my name has a T in it, I‚Äôm obsessed with tea - I‚Äôm currently training to be a tea sommelier and you can spot me around campus drinking one of my 15 cups of the day.
